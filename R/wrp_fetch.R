#' Fetch
#'
#' The FETCH function interacts with the Warp 10 Storage Engine to retrieve data according to given criteria.
#'
#' @inheritParams documentation
#' @param end Newest timestamp to consider when fetching datapoints.
#' @param start Oldest timestamp to consider when fetching datapoints.
#' @param timespan Depth to consider when fetching the datapoints.
#' If the value is positive then it is interpreted as a duration in time units,
#' if it is negative then as the maximum number of datapoints to fetch.
#' If negative, incompatible with `count`.
#' @param count Maximum number of datapoints to fetch for each GTS. Incompatible with negative 'timespan'.
#' @param selector A Geo Time Seriesâ„¢ selector with the syntax class{labels} where class is an exact match
#' or a regular expression starting with ~ and labels a comma separated list of labels selector
#' of the form name=exact or name~regexp.
#' Names and values must be percent URL encoded if needed.
#' @param selectors A list of GTS selectors, each with a syntax identical to that of 'selector'.
#' @param type Name of type to force for the GTS, either LONG, DOUBLE, BOOLEAN or STRING.
#'
#' @section Concerned Geo Time Series:
#'
#' FETCH selects Geo Time Series according to:
#'
#' + The selectors parameter, which is a list of selector.
#' + If selectors is not found, FETCH uses the selector parameter which is a single selector.
#' + If selector is not found, FETCH uses both class and labels parameters.
#'
#' @section Time window:
#'
#' FETCH begins from the newest value and stop when the oldest value is collected.
#' Thus, end must be defined in your request and defines the newest included value in your time window.
#' If end is anterior to your oldest value, the result will be empty (no Geo Time Series).
#' The span of the time window ending at end is then defined according to:
#'
#' + The timespan parameter.
#' + If timespan is not defined, FETCH collects a maximum of count point.
#' + If count is not defined, FETCH determines timespan with start.
#' If start is more recent than end, end and start are permuted internally.
#' Be careful, this means end is included but start is excluded from the time window.
